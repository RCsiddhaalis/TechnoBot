## Usage Instructions
The official Technobot instance is running in the "Land of AI" Discord server ([https://discord.gg/J6tCbwQBwY](https://discord.gg/J6tCbwQBwY))
In addition to Technobot, there are a variety of other bots with different functions on the server, so I highly recommend you take a look at it!
Feel free to join to use it and chat with the developers.

## Installation / Hosting Instructions:
Technobot is still currently in development, and resides in the ["Land of AI" Discord server](https://discord.gg/J6tCbwQBwY).
We would prefer if you didn't host your own instance of Technobot at the moment, and instead joined the Discord above so you can contribute/chat with the developers.
